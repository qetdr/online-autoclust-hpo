# Experiment Datasets
The present directory contains a script for creating reproducibly synthetic labeled datasets by using the `make_blobs` and make_blobs `make_s_curve` functions from the  `sklearn.datasets` module.

To create the datasets, you can run the following from the command line (given you are in the root directory of this project):
```python
python3 ./datasets/create_datasets.py
```
